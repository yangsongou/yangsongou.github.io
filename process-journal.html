                <p>Week 1 - This week is the first week, I was doing research about autonomous vehicle and device with my team member in order to exploring our own idea. The information I found online is mostly about autonomous car and drone. In addition, I communicated with other teams and their ideal concepts are likely to use these two autonomous devices. So, we are considering the idea that using autonomous car to deliver big items from furniture mart like Ikea. However, I think the environment of using autonomous car is too limited, there are too many conditions of traffic would affect the delivery, technical problem may influence our design largely.</p>

                <p>Week 2 - Last week my group had the idea of using autonomous car to deliver big items from furniture mart, but we were not satisfied of this idea and we were still exploring a better idea. Ben came up with the idea of using autonomous shopping cart at supermarket and we all thought this one was better than autonomous car because it was more innovative and had less use limitation. I also found some information about autonomous shopping cart online, there is an existing product of autonomous shopping cart called “dash robotic shopping cart”. It can navigate items and provide self-checkout service, these may also be the potential functions of our design but I need to do user research first to find out user needs. Thus, I was considering about the research methods and participants of my research. The research methods I planned to use are interview and contextual observation. For participants of my interview, everyone is a potential user of autonomous shopping cart because we all need to shop at supermarket. So, I contacted several friends who shop at supermarket frequently to be my interviewee.</p>

                <p>Week 3 - This week I finished my user research, the goal of my user research is to investigate current shopping experience of customers in supermarket and find out main problems they have. Contextual observation was used to observe customer behavior in the supermarket and analyze the main factors influence their behavior. For contextual observation, I found a cafe which is in front of the Coles and it was a nice place to observe customers in Coles easily. According to my observation result, I found that customers often check the condition of fresh goods; the situation that customers waste time on finding goods happens constantly; customers have to wait a long time for check out during the peak period of shopping. Interview was used to get in-depth understanding of current customer shopping experience and the main problems they have through specific conversation. I interviewed seven participants who I contacted previously last week and made an affinity diagram to collect findings from their answers. The findings showed that set hands free to pick up items is bothered for customer sometimes; wasting time on finding goods is a problem, asking stuffs for help does not make sense all the time; waiting too long for check out is bothered. To sum up, the result of my research showed four user needs, customers need to know condition of fresh food; customers need to find items quickly; customers need to pick up items efficiently; customers need to shorten time consumption on check out.</p>

                <p>Week 4&5&6 - I compared my research result with results from my team members research and found that wasting time on finding goods and check out are the common problems of customers at supermarket. Therefore, I put focus on how to solve these problems by the design during the prototype ideation with my team member. My idea was using mobile application to connect with the autonomous shopping cart and users do operations on the smart phone. Ben came up with the idea that users operate the autonomous shopping cart by a screen which is embedded on the cart and we were exploring more based on our initial ideas. The further vision of my idea was that users buy items on the mobile application and autonomous shopping cart finding out all the items and deliver these items to users, users even do not need to step in the supermarket. Then I drew out a series of wireframes for this idea and explained it to my tutor and classmates for feedback. However, the feedback showed that this idea was lack of interaction between users and autonomous shopping cart, it was more like an online shopping experience. So, I improved my idea to that users go to supermarket and connect with an autonomous shopping cart through the application, then users use the application to navigate items and the autonomous shopping cart will follow users, users can check out on the application after they finish shopping. I created a new series of wireframes of this improved idea and the feedback was much better this time, so I made iterations on it to create a paper prototype for user test and evaluation. The idea of Ben had been evolved as well, users go to the supermarket and get an autonomous shopping cart which has embedded screen, then search items on the screen and the autonomous shopping cart will lead users to those items, self-checkout function is available on the autonomous shopping cart. Ben also got his paper prototype ready for user test and evaluation.</p>

                <p>At the prototype ideation stage, I thought what I did well is that I asked my tutor or classmates for feedback after I created the wireframes or improved the wireframes. This helped me get broader ideas and judge am I on the right track of decision making while I was not sure about my decisions were appropriate or not. There also were some aspects I can make more progress at this stage. It would be better if I raised several more different ideas based on the same concept to explore more solutions, this may help me find a better idea after comparison and contrast. In addition, it would be better if I sketched more wireframes of same screen, it could help me place suitable functional sections on every screen in the best way after comparison and contrast or explore more good functional section.</p>

                <p>Week 7 - For the user test and evaluation, I and my team members found eight participants, they were all international university students and from our friends because international students were more likely to be confused in the supermarket when finding goods. Culture difference and language barrier make finding goods hard sometimes. Furthermore, the participants were the same to test my prototype and Ben’s prototype, we asked every participant to test my prototype first and test Ben’s prototype right after. This makes comparison and contrast between two prototypes more obvious and easier. Two respective tasks for two prototypes were given to users before user test, two methods “think aloud” and “interview” were applied for collecting user feedback and evaluation, “think aloud” allowed users say what they think during testing process, we could get some comments and advice directly through it, “interview” as supplementary method to support us asking questions about aspects which were not mentioned in “think aloud”. According to the user feedbacks, it was obvious that users preferred my prototype rather than Ben’s prototype, the main reason was that users felt more control when operating on mobile phone application. Therefore, we decided to make further development based on my prototype.</p>

                <p>At this testing and evaluation stage, I thought we had two aspects that can be improved. First is that the participants shouldn’t be all from our friends, due to the close relationship, the testing process was not so formal and participants might not give feedback seriously. If we find strange participants and do rewarding user tests, we could get more valuable feedbacks. Second is that we should give several more tasks to users for testing, it can help us find out more issues with the prototypes, the problem seeking ability is limited of single task.</p>

                <p>Week 8&9 - Although the user evaluation showed that my prototype was better than Ben’s, there was still a lot of weakness with this prototype. Not only the feedbacks of my prototype, but also feedbacks of Ben’s prototype reflected some common problems in both prototypes. There were some feedbacks about functions which users expected to use but the prototype didn’t have. For instance, users expected that the application could navigate multiple items in one route. There were some feedbacks about existing functions which users were not satisfied with as well. For example, users needed cancel button near every item listed on the checkout screen when they don’t want to buy it anymore. For the further development of low-fidelity prototype, we decided to use “sketch” create an iterative digital version based on all the feedbacks. The most significant improvement we made was that we added “shopping list” function, users could insert shopping list into the application in order to reach the goal that navigating all the items on shopping list in one route. Furthermore, we added some functional sections on the wireframes based on user feedbacks, such as indication of item stock and cancel buttons. We also refined the wireframes to make them connected more smoothly and layout for a better looking.</p>

                <p>Week 10&11&12 - For creating the high-fidelity prototype, we planned to add more details and refined whole visual style of the last digital prototype on sketch. Meanwhile, we were still exploring what we can improve more with user experience. Firstly, we gave the last digital prototype to our tutor and another group’s tutor for user test, the feedback was about that we can add a navigation process screen to show current progress of navigation and skip button to control navigation process well, words on buttons should clarify what would happen if the button is clicked, the connection between functional sections was a little bit confused. Based on these feedbacks, we created more screens and refined these screens to be a series of high-fidelity prototype. During this process, we checked other mobile application such as memorandum on IOS operating system and investigated how these applications work and their visual styles. As well as visual style refinement, the functional parts were evolved based on tutor’s feedback. We also connected these screens using Invision to create an interactive prototype and asked our friends for last user tests. It was obvious that we got less negative feedbacks of the prototype this time, only several tiny problems like adding instruction words we got and we did iterations right after.</p>

                <p>At the last stage creating high-fidelity prototype, I thought what my team did well is that we investigated other applications, this helped us know more about affordance and fixed some parts which may be misunderstood by users. However, through the whole user test and evaluation process, I found that different individuals may have different point of view at the same problem, it made us hesitating how to fix the problem, maybe that’s why finding more and more users for testing to find common problems is important.</p>
